I use the built-in version of Jekyll, provided by Github Pages.

## Tip

If you are starting with Github Pages, first use "minima" theme, other themes are crap.

## Categories

Categories are used in url:

```markdown
layout: post
title: "POST TITLE"
date: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss -0000
categories: foo bar
```

Will create `/foo/bar/YYYY/MM/DD/post-slug.html`
