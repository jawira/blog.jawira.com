title: "My book: Phing Cookbook - The PHP Build Tool"
---

Phing is a build tool written in PHP, last month I published [a book called
_Phing Cookbook_](https://leanpub.com/phing-cookbook/), however this book is not
finished yet.

I am writing this book because I want to share with my years of experience using
Phing.
The majority of developers are used to write YAML, JSON or any other
configuration language, however not many developers have to write XML.
Thus, the main objective of the book is to change the mind of all those
developers who believe that writing a Phing build file (in XML) is difficult,
and that's why this book is a _cookbook_: a very practical book with a
problem/solution approach.

The second objective is to help myself, indeed many times I have to navigate
between all my projects because I want to find out how I solved a specific
problem, having all the knowledge in one place will save me a lot of time.

Now, let me tell you, writing a book is hard, I started to write this book one
or two years ago, I was writing inconsistently, only when I had free time or
when I was _in the mood_. The consequence is that the book is not finished yet,
therefore I published the book unfinished and will publish a new chapter each
month until the book is finished. The november chapter is almost complete and it
will be published very soon.

[The book is available at LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/phing-cookbook/) at a
minimal cost, and it's free if you have a LeanPub membership!
